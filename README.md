# RockPaperScissors

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

I built a Rock Paper Scissors game that allows a player to choose a player icon, input their name, select a difficulty (standard rock, paper, scissors or a variant with 5 pieces instead of 3) and play a game against a computer that picks automatically, tallying the score for each side after every round. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
A person would just have to go to my github, open my RockPaperScissors repo, and clone it by copying the SSH link displayed after clicking the green "CODE" button on the top right area of the page. They would then go into their terminal, navigate to a directory they'd like to clone it into, type "git clone" then paste that SSH link and hit enter. Then they can open the repo, type "open index.html", hit enter, and they should be able to use the app. 

If they'd like to mess with the code in any way, they'd have to fork the repository before cloning it. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

I am about 1/4th through my total tenure at Turing. I worked on this project consistently over the course of 7 days, splitting up the workload evenly between those days.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
I worked with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The goal was to build a working version of the game, styled how we see fit, using DRY and pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

I struggled with efficiency in my code at times. I didn't even begin the project until I was sure that I knew how to structure my data model in a way that would make scaling up easy. Once I figured that out, it was relatively simple. 

A few wins: First, I learned a lot about writing efficient, DRY JS and simple HTML that makes styling, functionality, and structure straightforward and readable. I also learned a lot about more event handling, including ways to prevent events in certain conditions, set timeouts for other events, etc. Ultimately, though, the biggest win was managing my time, planning out the project step by step, and executing a vision that was unique to me. This was my first project where I didn't have a set of steps to follow or a comp to recreate.
